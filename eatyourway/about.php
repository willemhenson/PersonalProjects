            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>We are a group of first year students from the University of Manchester studying Computer Science and Mathematics.We created eatyourway as part of our First Year Team Project module. Our goal is to provide you with accessible dietary information without needing to examine the contents of your food packaging.</p>
            <h3>What is <i>eatyourway?</i></h3>
                <p><i>eatyourway</i> is a website that allows you to scan the barcode of over 2 million products and quickly access vital nutritional information including the presence of any allergens, the vegetarian and vegan staus and the environmental impact of the product. By creaing an account with eatyourway, you can customise your preferences allowing instant feedback on whether or not a product is the right choice for you. Just open our website, scan the product and have confidence in the choices you make.</p>
            <h3>Why use eatyourway?</h3>
                <p>Although there are many food scanning apps available for your use, from the NHS Food Scanner app to MyFitnessPal, <i>eatyourway</i> has two key advantages: you do not need to download an app and you don't need to create an account (although creating an account allows you to personalise your experience). This means that you can effortlessly access any nutritional information that you may need.</p>
